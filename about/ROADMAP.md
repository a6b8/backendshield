# ROADMAP - eERC-20 FlowMCP Integration

## Overview
Three-stage development plan for integrating privacy-preserving eERC-20 payments into FlowMCP for the hack2build Privacy Edition hackathon.

---

## Completed Work (Pre-Stage 1)

### Custom GPT Development
- [x] Created "Encrypted ERC20 Expert" GPT - shared with all hackathon participants
- [x] Created "Hack2Build Assistant" GPT - specific to this project implementation

---

## Stage 1: Foundation (By August 23, 2025)

### Deliverables
- Deploy basic eERC-20 token on Avalanche C-Chain
- Create initial MCP server draft on community.flowmcp.org
- Repository with basic documentation

### Completed Research & Documentation
- [x] Comprehensive research collection organized in resources/ folder
- [x] eERC-20 complete documentation assembled
- [x] x402 protocol whitepaper and implementation studied
- [x] MCP documentation compiled
- [x] FlowMCP core and server code analyzed
- [x] PROJECT.md created with clear project definition
- [x] RESOURCES.md created for quick reference guide
- [x] ABOUT.md with project overview
- [x] Repository structure established
- [x] AI conversation analysis (decision documents and PRD)
- [x] Analyzed Avalabs eERC-20 SDK
- [x] Studied backend converter repository
- [x] Reviewed x402-core and middleware implementations
- [x] Identified integration points between eERC-20 and x402

### Key Tasks
- [ ] **August 21**: Attend Office Hours for feedback and guidance
- [ ] **August 22**: Implement feedback from Office Hours
- [ ] Deploy minimal eERC-20 token contract
- [ ] Set up basic MCP server structure
- [ ] Create simple credit conversion mechanism
- [x] Document architecture and approach
- [x] Push working code to repository

### Success Criteria
- Working eERC-20 token deployed
- Basic MCP server accessible at community.flowmcp.org
- Office Hours feedback incorporated
- Clear documentation of concept

## Stage 2: Iteration (By September 7, 2025)

### Focus Areas
- Enhance based on Stage 1 learnings and feedback
- Develop GTM strategy
- Improve core functionality

### Flexible Milestones
- Iterate on MCP server based on testing
- Refine credit system implementation
- Create basic integration tests
- Define target market and value proposition
- Prepare progress report on Stage 1 goals

### GTM Strategy Outline
- Target: MCP server operators and AI developers
- Value: Privacy-preserving micropayments with minimal friction
- Distribution: FlowMCP community platform

## Stage 3: MVP (By September 16, 2025)

### Final Deliverables
- Functional MVP on community.flowmcp.org/eerc20
- Live pitch presentation
- Working end-to-end demo

### Core Features
- Complete payment flow demonstration
- Privacy features verification
- Basic user interface
- Integration with x402 protocol

### Demo Scenarios
1. USDC to eERC-20 credit conversion
2. Private transaction execution
3. Credit balance management

## Technical Stack
- **Blockchain**: Avalanche C-Chain
- **Token**: eERC-20 with ZK proofs
- **Protocol**: x402 (credit-based modification)
- **Server**: Node.js 22 with ES modules

## Key Innovation
Credit-based system instead of per-request payments, reducing transaction overhead while maintaining privacy through eERC-20 encryption.
