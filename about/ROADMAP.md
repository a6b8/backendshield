## Stage 2: Iteration (By September 7, 2025)

### Focus Areas (Updated based on Stage 1 Success)
- Build on deployed eERC-20 system with x402 integration
- Develop MCP server implementation using live contracts
- Create user-friendly interfaces for privacy features
- Integrate with FlowMCP platform

### Flexible Milestones
- Implement x402 payment flow using deployed eERC-20 contracts
- Create MCP server prototype with privacy-enabled credit system
- Build client library for seamless eERC-20 integration
- Develop basic web interface for contract interaction
- Test private transactions between demo accounts
- Document Stage 1 deployment success and prepare Stage 2 goals

### GTM Strategy (Enhanced)
- **Target**: MCP server operators, AI developers, privacy-focused applications
- **Value**: Live privacy token system with zero-knowledge proofs and regulatory compliance
- **Advantage**: First working eERC-20 implementation for MCP payments
- **Distribution**: FlowMCP community platform with live contract demonstrations

---

## Stage 3: MVP (By September 16, 2025)

### Final Deliverables (Building on Live System)
- Complete BackendShield MCP server on community.flowmcp.org/backendshield
- Live demonstration using deployed eERC-20 contracts
- Working end-to-end privacy payment flows
- Integration showcase with existing deployed infrastructure

### Core Features (Enhanced with Live Contracts)
- Complete privacy payment flow using live eERC-20 system
- Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification demonstrations  
- User-friendly interface for deployed contract interaction
- Full x402 protocol integration with privacy tokens
- Regulatory compliance showcase with auditor capabilities

### Demo Scenarios (Using Live Contracts)
1. **ERC-20 → eERC-20 Conversion**: Convert BackendShield tokens to private tokens
2. **Private Transfer Execution**: Zero-knowledge transfer between demo accounts
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Auditor decryption of transaction amounts
4. **Credit Balance Management**: MCP server credit system with privacy
5. **x402 Integration**: Payment flows for MCP server access
