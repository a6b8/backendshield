## Stage 2: FlowMCP Integration (By September 7, 2025)

### Focus Areas (Building on Provider Revenue Infrastructure)
- Build on deployed eERC-20 system for provider payouts
- Develop API platform integration for usage metrics collection
- Create provider-friendly interfaces for earnings monitoring
- Implement fair revenue distribution algorithms

### Flexible Milestones
- Implement API platform usage metrics collection using deployed contracts
- Create PrivateShare revenue calculation engine for fair provider compensation
- Build provider dashboard for encrypted earnings monitoring
- Develop usage analytics system for transparent revenue distribution
- Test private payout transactions between demo provider accounts
- Integrate with API platforms for provider testing

### GTM Strategy (Provider-Focused)
- **Target**: API providers in FlowMCP ecosystem, especially small/independent providers
- **Value**: Fair revenue distribution with competitor-blind earnings and micro-precision payouts
- **Advantage**: First working eERC-20 implementation for private provider revenue sharing
- **Distribution**: FlowMCP community platform with live provider payout demonstrations

## Stage 3: Production MVP (By September 16, 2025)

### Final Deliverables (Complete Provider Revenue System)
- Complete PrivateShare provider revenue system integrated with API platforms
- Live demonstration using deployed eERC-20 contracts for provider payouts
- Working end-to-end provider revenue distribution flows
- Real-world testing with multiple API providers on supported platforms

### Core Features (Provider Revenue MVP)
- Complete provider revenue distribution using live eERC-20 system
- Zero-knowledge proof generation for encrypted provider earnings
- Provider dashboard for earnings monitoring and claims
- API platform integration with usage metrics collection
- Regulatory compliance with auditor visibility for revenue totals

### Demo Scenarios (Real Provider Revenue Distribution)
1. **Provider Registration**: API providers join PrivateShare system
2. **Usage Tracking**: API platforms collect API usage metrics
3. **Revenue Distribution**: Encrypted payouts based on actual usage
4. **Earnings Claims**: Providers withdraw encrypted earnings on-chain
5. **Competitor Blindness**: Demonstrate private earnings with auditor transparency
